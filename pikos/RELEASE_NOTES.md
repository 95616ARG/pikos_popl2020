IKOS version 2.0 release notes
==============================

Release date
------------

October 2018

List of changes
---------------

### IKOS Core changes

* Updated the directory structure:
   - Renamed `algorithms` to `adt`;
   - Renamed `iterator` to `fixpoint`;
   - Added subdirectories under `domain` and `value` for each group of domains;
   - Added a `legacy` folder with unmaintained code. It will be removed in the future.
* Improved abstract domain interfaces using CRTP. Removed all the abstract domain traits.
* Added generic traits:
   - `DumpableTraits` to dump an object on a stream, for debugging purpose;
   - `IndexableTraits` to get a unique index representing an object;
   - `GraphTraits` to traverse a graph. It replaces the previous control flow graph API.
* Added a faster implementation of Patricia trees.
* Added machine integer abstract domains.
* Added unit tests using Boost.Test.
* Implemented a new pointer constraints system solver, previously called `pta`.
* Implemented `machine_int::PolymorphicDomain`, a machine integer abstract domain using runtime polymorphism that allows to use different abstract domains at runtime.
* Implemented `machine_int::NumericDomainAdapter`, a machine integer abstract domain wrapping a numeric abstract domain.
* Added abstract domain operators to perform widening with a threshold.
* Added a flow-sensitive context-sensitive pointer analysis in `ValueDomain`.

### Analyzer changes

* Moved most of the implementation from the header files into the `src` directory.
* Remove the `--ikos-pp` option. It is recommended not to use optimizations.
* Added the `--domain` option, to choose the numerical abstract domain at runtime.
* Added the `--hardware-addresses` option, for software using Direct Memory Access (DMA).
* Added the `--argc` option, to specify the value of `argc` during the analysis.
* Added support for global variable dynamic initialization.
* Added support for the `volatile` keyword.
* Fix exception propagation analysis for C++.
* Added `ikos/analyzer/intrinsic.h`, a header file with IKOS intrinsics.
* Improved database writes by creating a new transaction every 8192 queries.
* Updated the output database schema to store more information about the source code.
* Improved the uninitialized variable analysis.
* Added a pass to find widening hints.
* Improved warning and error messages using LLVM debug information.
* Implemented several checks:
   - signed and unsigned integer overflow (sio, uio);
   - invalid shift count (shc);
   - pointer overflow (poa);
   - invalid pointer comparison (pcmp);
   - invalid function call (fca);
   - dead code (dca);
   - double free and lifetime analysis (dfa);
   - unsound analysis (sound).

### AR changes

* Implemented a new Abstract Representation, based on the design of LLVM. The main changes are:
   - Improved memory management using clear ownership. The context owns types, a bundle owns functions, etc;
   - Added `isa<>`, `cast<>` and `dyn_cast<>` utilities, Ã  la LLVM;
   - Added integer signedness information in the type system;
   - Added overflow and wrapping behaviours for integer operations;
   - Added visitors for statements and values;
   - Added intrinsics functions;
   - Added support for the `volatile` attribute;
   - Added traceability utilities, allowing to attach debug information to an AR object.
* Added a static type checker.
* Removed the branching-opt pass and added the simplify-cfg pass, a simpler version.
* Added the simplify upcast comparison pass.

### LLVM frontend changes

* Added 3 different optimization levels in ikos-pp (none, basic and aggressive)
* Implemented a new translation from LLVM to Abstract Representation (AR). The main changes are:
   - In memory translation instead of writing into a file;
   - Attach LLVM debug information to AR;
   - Recover integer signedness information from debug information and several heuristics.
* Added the ikos-import tool. It translates LLVM bitcode into AR, useful for debugging.
* Added regression tests for the new translation from LLVM to AR.

### CMake changes

* Add a target `check` that builds and runs all the tests.

### Ikos-View changes

* Added ikos-view, a web interface to examine IKOS results.

### Overall changes

* Updated the naming convention.

### IKOS Core changes

* Added an implementation of the Gauge domain.
* Combined the memory domain and the pointer domain, improving the precision for arrays of pointers and virtual tables.

### LLVM Frontend changes

In this release we upgraded our LLVM frontend from version 2.9 to 3.7.

To have a C/C++ program fully represented in AR, there are several code transformation we had to handle with the frontend's intermediate representation. When using the LLVM framework as the frontend, we transform the following LLVM instructions so they can be expressed in AR:

* `phi` instruction
* `getelementptr` instruction
* `insertvalue` and `extractvalue` instructions
* `i/fcmp` and `select` instructions
* removed `br`
* `constantexpr` and its subclasses
* translation of intrinsic calls to AR-supported intrinsic calls. We currently support `memset`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, `vastart`, `vaend`, `va_arg`, and `vacopy`.

In the previous release v0.0.1 we handled all transformation in **ARBOS**. The previous tool chain architecture defined another intermediate representation, called **AIR**, that served as a direct translation from the LLVM bitcode to an S-expression format that was fed into **ARBOS**. **ARBOS** then parsed and transformed **AIR** to **AR** in memory.

This release removes **AIR** entirely. All transformation are done in **LLVMAR**, while **ABROS** only parses the AR and makes it available in memory for ARBOS analysis plugins to traverse and perform analysis on it.

### ARBOS API changes

* Each `AR_Global_Variable` may contain an initializer represented as `AR_Code`. In the previous release we dedicated an initializer function for each global variable. These initializer functions were individually invoked in `main()`. In this release, analyzers need to dive into the initializer of an `AR_Global_Variable` to analyze the initializer code.
* Differentiates between store vs. real sizes of an `AR_Type`.
* Supports `varags` intrinsic calls in the AR. This was not supported in the previous release.
* Function pointers are now available in the AR model; they were misinterpreted and were not available in the previous release.
