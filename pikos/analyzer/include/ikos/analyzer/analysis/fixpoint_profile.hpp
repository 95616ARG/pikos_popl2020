///
/// This analysis is intended to be used before the computation of any fixpoint.
///
/// It generates a FixpointProfile for each function, providing widening hints
/// to help the fixpoint computation. It basically iterates on the cycles in the
/// code and looks for constants which could be involved in the loop guard.
///
/// For instance, if we have the following code:
///
/// \code{.c}
/// for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
///   do_something();
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// It will mark the constant '10' as a widening hint.
